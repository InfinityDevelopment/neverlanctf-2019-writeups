Hmm.

Time to use ls from Bash 1

Command: ls

Nothing. Let's search everything

Well last file was txt, lets search for txts
(Looking back at it now, I could've just used 'find . -type f -name "*"')
But first, we need to go up the directory to search everything. That means we need to use the cd command, which moves you directory in the machine.
Fun Fact: using "cd .." means you go up ONE directory

Command: cd ..
Command: cd ..

Now we need to use the find command. We define that we're looking for files with "-type f", and the name with '-name "*.txt"'

Command: find . -type f -name "*.txt"

First result without Permission denied: ./home/level1/.honor-code.txt

Command: cd home/level1/

Time to use nano again!
Command: nano .honor-code.txt

Found the flag!
