ls time

Command: ls

Found
canyoufindme.txt

Every flag has had the word honor in it so far... Let's use grep. Grep is a command that allows you to find text in files (among many other uses, but for the purpouse of this challenge, we're using it for this purpouse now)

Command: grep 'honor' canyoufindme.txt

Nope. Let's exclude spaces. Using the command with the -v (essentially exclude) flag and appending looking for 'honor' narrows it down.

Command: grep -v ' ' canyoufindme.txt canyoufindme.txt | grep 'honor' 

Aha. We found:
level3:child-of-honor

Seems that every flag is going to be in the formamt of "level*:<flag>" now. Let's take note of that.

Flagaroni:
child-of-honor
