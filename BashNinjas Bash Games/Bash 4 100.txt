Command: ls

We fouond a file called random (that's apparently a binary file).

Command: nano random

Yep. Definetly not plaintext. Let's use the strings command. Strings is kind of hard to explain in its entirety, but in essence its a useful tool for getting plaintext data from files.

Command: strings random

Progress. We're getting plaintext without "odd" characters at this point. Let's append grep to that to find the "level" string in this output to find our flag.

Command: strings random | grep 'level'

Eureka! Seems our "formula" works. Here we are.
level4:only*hack^things%you$own

Flag:
only*hack^things%you$own
