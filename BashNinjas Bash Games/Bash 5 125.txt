Command: ls

There's a file called "nextlevel"

Command: nano nextlevel

Ok. Not readable.
The "file" command can actually figure this out for us. It's great for figuring out what a file's actual format is.

Command: file nextlevel
Output: nextlevel: gzip compressed data, was "principles.txt", last modified: Fri Mar 30 08:05:12 2018, max compression, from Unix

So essentially this means that gzip compressed this. Well, lets try to use gzip (using the -d flag which means decompress)

Command: gzip -d nextlevel

Nope... We get a weird error. If we look this up the clear answer is not immediate, but eventually I found a source that says this may have to do with the file extension. So lets change it by using the copy command.
We'll be using the copy command to make a copy of the file with the right extension (with hacking, always try to never destroy the original source file!).

Command: cp nextlevel nextlevel.gz

Got this file. Let's try it again.

Command: gzip -d nextlevel.gz

Aha. It asks us to overwrite. In this case, I think its alright. Lets do it and use nano again.

Command: nano nextlevel

Got it. We found:
level5:on-my-honor-i-will-do-my-best

Flag:
on-my-honor-i-will-do-my-best
