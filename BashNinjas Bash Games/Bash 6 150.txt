Command: ls

We found values.txt and Syl.jpg

Ok well. can't look at image files with a terminal. Let's check the TXT

Command: nano values.txt

Well this recommends us use an SSH file transfer command. This requires I break down the scp command.
The basic command is "scp [username@host:file] [where the file will be saved]"
We need to use the Port flag, -P <port> because our target doesn't use the regular SSH port.

Command: scp -P 3333 level5@157.230.73.80:Syl.jpg Syl.jpg

Got it.

We opens this file and it has this string in it:
level6:have-you-memorized-the-code-yet

Got the flag:
have-you-memorized-the-code-yet
