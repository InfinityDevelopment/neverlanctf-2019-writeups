Command: ls

Well we found level7.txt

Command: nano level7.txt

Alright. If you've done some Crypto, this is Base64. I'd rather decode this on a desktop/website, so lets download it.

Command: scp -P 3333 level6@157.230.73.80:level7.txt level7.txt

Got it. Open it up and C/P

Website: base64decode.org

When we decode this we get some text and:
level7:white-hats-have-values-and-rules

Flag:
white-hats-have-values-and-rules
