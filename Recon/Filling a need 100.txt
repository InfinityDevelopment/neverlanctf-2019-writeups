After extensive searching of companies founded in September 2001 and September 24th 2001, found Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
This popular tool for cybersecurity people. Birthday is September 24th, 2001.
From the sense of NeverLAN CTF, I assume this would be filling a need.

Putting in the name doesn't return correct, so we need to adapt to flag format:
flag{Open_Web_Application_Security_Project}
